# ICTVTaxoChallenge_model
   This is a deep learning model developed to participate in the challenge proposed by ICTV. Its primary function is to classify a set of unknown viral sequences. This model is based on GP-GCN (Gapped Pattern Graph Convolutional Networks) that utilizes RSCU (Relative Synonymous Codon Usage) and TNF (Tetra-Nucleotide Frequencies) to improve the annotation and estimation quality of the  taxonomic classifier. The model is trained on annotated viruses dataset published by ICTV.
